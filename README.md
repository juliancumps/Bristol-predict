# Bristol Predict BETA 3.0🐟


Real-time salmon harvest data visualization and historical analysis for the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery.

## Overview

Bristol Predict is a comprehensive web application designed for commercial fishermen and data enthusiasts to explore Bristol Bay's sockeye salmon fishery data. The platform provides interactive maps, real-time catch visualization, historical trend analysis, and comparative benchmarking tools to help users understand the complex dynamics of the fishery.

## Features

### Core Tools

Interactive Map - Click on districts to explore historical and current catch data from Naknek-Kvichak, Egegik, Ugashik, Nushagak, and Togiak regions

Multi-District Charts - Line and bar charts displaying daily catch trends across all districts for selected dates or date ranges

Pie Chart Distribution - Visual breakdown of catch by district to identify which zones are performing on any given date

Historical Trends - Visualize sockeye per delivery metrics across seasons and years to understand long-term patterns and seasonal variations

Catch Efficiency Analyzer - Enter your delivery data and benchmark your catch performance against district averages

Weather Dashboard - Live NOAA weather data, tidal predictions, wind and wave maps from Windy.com, and temperature forecasts

More Salmon Harvest Data - State-wide and region-specific data visualization with interactive Tableau dashboards for comprehensive analysis

### Data Access

Complete Historical Context - Access to three seasons of backfilled data (2023-2025) with long-term pattern analysis

Real-time Data Integration - Automatically pulls the latest data from Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) daily

Benchmark Your Performance - Compare your catch data against district averages to understand your position in the fishery
